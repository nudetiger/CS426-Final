1. Project Overview

For the final project, each group designs and builds a complete, working Android application on a topic of your own choosing — no prior topic approval is required. The app should solve a realistic problem for a clearly identified set of users (for example, a personal expense tracker, a study-planning tool, a local-events finder, or a small-business ordering app). It must go beyond a single static screen: expect at least three to four meaningfully connected screens, persistent local data, and integration with an external data source or device capability such as a REST API, camera, location services, or notifications. You are free to use any stack covered in the course (Kotlin/Java with Android SDK, Jetpack Compose, or Flutter/React Native), provided the final product is a native-installable Android app.

2. Group Formation

Work in groups of 2 to 4 members. Groups form themselves, and no advance registration of members or topic is needed. Divide the work clearly among all members and document that division in your report.

3. Deliverables

Submit a single compressed file named after the student IDs of all group members, separated by underscores and listed in ascending order — for example 2012345_2012350_2012361.zip.

Inside the archive, organise your files exactly as follows:

2012345_2012350_2012361/
├── README.md              # Group members (ID + full name), project title,
│                          # demo video link, build instructions, test account
│                          # credentials if the app requires login
├── src/                   # Full application source code
│   └── ...                # (exclude build, .gradle, node_modules, .idea)
├── apk/
│   └── app-release.apk    # Installable build, Android API 24+
├── report/
│   └── report.pdf         # 10–30 pages
└── video/
    └── demo-link.txt      # The demo video link goes here
Each item is required:

Full source code of the application (exclude build output directories such as build, .gradle, and node_modules). If you use Git, include the .git folder so commit history is visible; otherwise export the log to src/git-log.txt.
An installable Android build (.apk, release or signed debug) that installs and runs on a physical device or emulator running Android API 24 or higher. This is mandatory — a project without a working APK will not be graded.
A report (PDF, 10–30 pages) covering the project topic, target users, application architecture, technologies used, setup and installation instructions, the work-division table, and a self-assessment of what was completed.
A demo video (5–10 minutes) that includes the presentation: introduce the topic, explain your technical approach, and demonstrate the main features live on a device. All members must speak, and the video should make clear who presents which part. Upload the video to Google Drive or YouTube (unlisted is fine) and put the link in video/demo-link.txt — there is no need to enter it in the form. Make sure sharing is set so that anyone with the link can view it; a link that cannot be opened counts as no video submitted.
4. Deadline and Submission

Deadline: 23h59 on 5/9/2026.

Submit through the Google Form at: https://forms.gle/KdcR2BaASEGx2RCeA 

Submission instructions:

Only one representative per group fills in the form; other members should not submit again, to avoid duplicate entries.
Upload the .zip file directly through the form, using the student-ID naming format and folder structure described above. If the file exceeds the size limit, upload it to Google Drive instead, paste the link into the form, and set sharing so that anyone with the link can view it.
After submitting, you will receive a confirmation email from Google Forms — keep it as proof of submission. No confirmation means your work has not been submitted.
5. Grading Criteria (out of 10)

No.	Criterion	What is assessed	Weight
1	Functional completeness	The app installs and runs reliably on Android; the features described in the report are all implemented; no critical defects such as crashes, freezes, or data loss	30%
2	Technical quality & source code	Sound architecture with clear separation of UI, logic, and data; correct application of course techniques (lifecycle handling, local storage, API calls, asynchronous work, runtime permissions); readable, well-organised code	25%
3	User interface & user experience	Intuitive and consistent UI; sensible navigation; adapts to different screen sizes; handles loading, empty, error, and offline states gracefully	20%
4	Originality & complexity	A practical idea with a creative element; difficulty appropriate to the group size; not a copy of an existing template or tutorial project	15%
5	Report, presentation & collaboration	Complete, well-structured report; clear demo video and coherent presentation; every member has contributed	10%
